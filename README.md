# fertilizer calculator
I've create a single html file. It will contain a database of fertilizer recommendations for different crops, a function to calculate the dosage based on your inputs, and a simple command-line interface to interact with the app.

Key Functionalities:
1. User Inputs: You can enter the land area and select the unit (Decimal, Katha, Bigha, Acre, or Hectare). Then, you choose the crop from a dropdown menu.
2. Backend Data: The fertilizer recommendations for different crops (Paddy, Wheat, Jute, etc.), based on standard Bangladeshi agricultural data, are embedded directly into the code.
3. Calculation: When you click the "Calculate" button, the JavaScript code converts your land area to hectares, finds the recommended dosage for your selected crop, and calculates the total amount of Urea, TSP (Triple Superphosphate), and MoP (Muriate of Potash) needed.
4. Output: The results are displayed clearly in kilograms.

The whole project was done in HTML Notepad++
