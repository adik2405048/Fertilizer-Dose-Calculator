Project: Fertilizer Dosage Calculator
I developed this project using a foundational web stack: html for the structure, JavaScript for the calculation logic & most importantly pure handwritten CSS for all the styling. The backend logic is powered by agricultural data based on Bangladesh Krishi Rules.

Key Features:

• User Inputs: You can enter the land area and select the unit (Decimal, Katha, Bigha, Acre, or Hectare). Then, you choose the crop from a dropdown menu.

• Backend Data: The fertilizer recommendations for different crops (Paddy, Wheat, Jute, etc.), based on standard Bangladeshi agricultural data, are embedded directly into the code.

• Calculation: When you click the "Calculate" button, the JavaScript code converts your land area to hectares, finds the recommended dosage for your selected crop, & calculates the total amount of Urea, TSP & MoP needed.

• Instant & Accurate Results: Instantly calculates the required amount of Urea, TSP, and MoP in kilograms.

This calculator helps farmers to apply the right amount of fertilizer no more, no less. This prevents resource wastage, saves money, improves crop yield, & promotes more sustainable farming practices. It's a small step towards precision agriculture, made accessible for all.
